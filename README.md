## Memory Game HTML Project## 

This HTML project implements a classic memory game using JavaScript. Players are presented with a grid of balls, each containing a number. The objective is to find matching pairs of balls with the same number within a set time limit. The game randomly generates a set of numbers, assigns them to pairs of balls, and shuffles their positions to ensure each game is unique. 

# Key Features:
Interactive gameplay: Players click on balls to reveal their numbers and attempt to find matching pairs.
- Timer: A countdown timer adds a sense of urgency to the game, challenging players to match all pairs before time runs out.
- Win condition: Players are alerted upon successfully matching all pairs within the time limit.
- Restart option: Players can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Play Again" button.

This project serves as a fun exercise in DOM manipulation and event handling using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Feel free to clone or fork this repository to explore, modify, or enhance the memory game according to your preferences. Happy gaming!
